**Problem Statement:**<br>
  A medical clinic assigns a token number to every patient who visits. The token number starts from 1 and it is given based on the order of arrival, to the n patients who arrive. But, the receptionist accepts bribe and lets a person k in first. The task is to print the token number and the patient's name in the order in which they see the doctor.

**Format:**<br>
* Get n
* For every person that arrives, store their name and token number.
* Get k
* Print kth person's token number and name followed by the rest.

**Example**:
<br>
Let n be 5<br>
Let the patient's details be:<br>
token no - name<br>
1 a<br>
2 b<br>
3 c<br>
4 d<br>

Let k be c, then the order will be:<br>
